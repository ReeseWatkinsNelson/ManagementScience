This repository shows Decision-Making Spreadsheet Models in Excel to answer 
a variety of unqiue business problems. These problems are from Midterm/Final
assignments in Applied Management Science.

Applied Management Science focuses on using Linear Programming to solve complex
business scenarios faced by decision-makers. Its applications are vast, ranging
from Operations, Investing, Transportation, Network-based, and more. 

Ultimately, the course helps me understand the thinking, structuring, and application
of spreadsheet models to find optimized solutions.

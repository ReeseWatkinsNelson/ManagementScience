This repository shows Decision-Making Spreadsheet Models in Excel to answer 
a variety of complex business problems. 

Applied Management Science focuses on using Linear Programming to solve complex
business scenarios faced by decision-makers. Its applications are vast, ranging
from Operations, Investing, Transportation, Network-based, and more. 

In addition to the Programming models, learning to interpret Sensitivity and Answer 
Reports provides the means to understand how data can be manipulated and still provide 
optimal solutions taking the analysis a step-further.

Ultimately, the course helps me understand the thinking, structuring, and application
of spreadsheet models to find optimized solutions. 

Composed within the directories are Excel Assignments completed for Midterm/Final
assignments answering several business scenarios.
